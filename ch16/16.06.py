# Write a function called mul_time that takes a Time object and a number and
# returns a new Time object that contains the product of the original Time and
# the number.
# Then use mul_time to write a function that takes a Time object that 
# represents the finishing time in a race, and a number that represents the 
# distance, and returns a Time object that represents the average pace (time
# per mile).

# Current Status: Incomplete
