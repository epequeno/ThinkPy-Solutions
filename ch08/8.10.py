# Read the documentation of the string methods at 
# docs.python.org/lib/string-methods.html. You might want to experiment with
# some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are
# particularly useful.
# The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in
# find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub 
# is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is 
# optional.
