# Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips
# whitespace and punctuation from the words, and converts them to lowercase.
# Hint: The string module provides strings named whitespace, which contains
# space, tab, newline, etc., and punctuation which contains the punctuation
# characters. Let's see if we can make Python swear:
# >>> import string
# >>> print string.punctuation
# !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
# Also, you might consider using the string methods strip, replace and 
# translate.
