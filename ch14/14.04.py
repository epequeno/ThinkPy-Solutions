# Type this example into a file named wc.py and run it as a script. Then run
# the Python interpreter and import wc. What is the value of __name__ when
# the module is being imported?
# Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does
# nothing. It does not re-read the file, even if it has changed.
# If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload,
# but it can be tricky, so the safest thing to do is restart the interpreter
# and then import the module again.
