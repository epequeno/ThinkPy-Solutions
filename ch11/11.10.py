# Here's another Puzzler from Car Talk :
# This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O'Leary. He came upon a common one-
# syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique property.
# When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of
# the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. Replace the
# first letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter and the 
# result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question is, 
# what's the word?
# Now I'm going to give you an example that doesn't work. Let's look at the 
# five-letter word, 'wrack.' W-R-A-C-K, you know like to 'wrack with pain.' If
# I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter word, 'R-A-C-K.' As 
# in, 'Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a
# nine-pointer!' It's a perfect homophone. If you put the 'w' back, and remove
# the 'r,' instead, you're left with the word, 'wack,' which is a real word, 
# it's just not a homophone of the other two words. But there is, however, at 
# least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two homophones if 
# you remove either of the first two letters to make two, new four-letter words. # The question is, what's the word?
# You can use the dictionary from Exercise 11.1 to check whether a string is in
# the word list.
# To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing 
# Dictionary. You can download it from 
# www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict or from thinkpython.com/code/c06d 
# and you can also download thinkpython.com/code/pronounce.py, which provides
# a function named read_dictionary that reads the pronouncing dictionary and 
# returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that 
# describes its primary pronunciation.
# Write a program that lists all the words that solve the Puzzler. You can see
# my solution at thinkpython.com/code/homophone.py.
