# Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys
# in a dictionary. It doesn't matter what the values are. Then you can use
# the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the 
# dictionary. If you did Exercise 10.8, you can compare the speed of this
# implementation with the list in operator and the bisection search.
