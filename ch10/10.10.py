# Two words "interlock" if taking alternating letters from each forms a new 
# word.
# For example, "shoe" and "cold" interlock to form "schooled."
# 1. Write a program that finds all pairs of words that interlock. Hint: 
# don’t enumerate all pairs!
# 2. Can you find any words that are three-way interlocked; that is, every 
# third letter forms a word, starting from the first, second or third?
