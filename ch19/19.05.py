# A vector graphics editor is a program that allows users to draw and edit
# shapes on the screen and generate output files in vector graphics formats
# like Postscript and SVG1 .
# Write a simple vector graphics editor using Tkinter. At a minimum, it should
# allow users to draw lines, circles and rectangles, and it should use 
# Canvas.dump to generate a Postscript description of the contents of the 
# Canvas. As a challenge, you could allow users to select and resize items 
# on the Canvas.
