# Write an add method for Points that works with either a Point object or a 
# tuple:
# -If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new Point 
# whose x coordinate is the sum of the x coordinates of the operands, and 
# likewise for the y coordinates.
# -If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the first element 
# of the tuple to the x coordinate and the second element to the y coordinate,
# and return a new Point with the result.

# Current Status: Incomplete
